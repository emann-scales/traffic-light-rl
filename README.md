# Intelligent Traffic Light Control System using Reinforcement Learning ðŸš¦

This project demonstrates an intelligent traffic light system powered by **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.
It uses **Python** and **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)** to train an RL agent that reduces congestion at a four-way intersection.

## Features
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning demo)
- SUMO traffic simulation (placeholder config files)
- Comparison-ready setup for fixed-time vs RL

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- SUMO (https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/)
- Libraries: numpy

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-light-rl.git
   cd traffic-light-rl
   ```
2. Run simulation demo:
   ```bash
   python traffic_rl.py
   ```
